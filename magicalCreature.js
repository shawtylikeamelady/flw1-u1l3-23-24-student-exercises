// Welcome to the magical zoo! Your task is to create and manage a list of magical creatures. Let's have some fun!

// 1. Declare a variable named 'creatureName' and assign it a magical creature's name as a string.
let creatureName = "a floating dead gojo";
let creatureDescription = "it can fly, its dead, it only has one half of a body, its truly a phanomnon"

let isFriendly = true;
let visitorAge = Math.floor(Math.random() * 60) + 1 ;
console.log(visitorAge)


let canVisit = visitorAge > 15 ; 

console.log ("this " + creatureName + "is" + creatureDescription + " and its" +  isFriendly + "that it is friendly, if you are" + visitorAge)
// 2. Declare a variable named 'creatureDescription' and describe its magical properties as a string.


// 3. Do you believe that this creature is friendly to humans? 
// Declare a variable named 'isFriendly' and assign it a boolean value.



// 4. The magical zoo has an age restriction! Declare a variable named 'visitorAge' and assign it a random age between 1 and 60.
// Hint: Use Math.floor() to round a number up.
// Hint: Use Math.random() for generating random numbers.



// 5. Determine if the visitor is allowed to see the creature.
// Declare a variable named 'canVisit' and assign it an expression to see 
// if the visitorAge variable is greater than 15.
// Hint: use this resource if you need support: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp 



// 6. Combine all the information into a summary.
// Declare a variable named 'zooSummary' and combine all the above information using concatenation.


// 7. Print the summary using console.log()



// Challenge:
// 8. Now, imagine there are three more creatures in the zoo. 
//    Repeat Tasks 1-6 for each creature, then combine all summaries into a single variable 'allZooSummaries'.
// 9. Print the 'allZooSummaries' to see the details of all the creatures in the magical zoo.
